# Living Neural Society Simulation Framework

## Overview
A sophisticated HTML-based simulation framework designed to generate emergent narratives through complex agent interactions. This system creates a living, breathing digital world where societies evolve, cultures form, and stories emerge organically from the interactions of sentient agents.

## Core Philosophy
- **Emergent Storytelling**: Stories are not pre-written but generated through agent interactions
- **Neural Intelligence**: Each agent operates with a neural network-based cognitive model
- **Social Complexity**: Relationships, trust, and social dynamics drive behavior
- **Environmental Pressure**: The world itself shapes agent behavior and societal development
- **Generational Evolution**: Long-term changes across multiple generations

## Architecture Layers

### üß† AI Core Layer
- **Neural Networks**: LSTM/Transformer-based decision making
- **Memory Systems**: Persistent agent memory and learning
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Reward-based behavior adaptation
- **Emotional Models**: Fear, trust, happiness as decision weights

### üë• Social Layer
- **Relationship Graph**: Dynamic social network with weighted connections
- **Communication Systems**: Symbolic tokens to natural language generation
- **Faction Formation**: Tribes, alliances, and social hierarchies

### üåç World Layer
- **Biome Systems**: Environmental pressure and resource distribution
- **Territory Management**: Strategic locations and natural borders
- **Resource Economics**: Scarcity-driven innovation and conflict

### üèòÔ∏è Civilization Layer
- **Government Evolution**: From councils to monarchies to democracies
- **Technology Trees**: Cultural and technological advancement
- **Infrastructure**: Buildings, trade routes, and urban development

### ‚öîÔ∏è Conflict Layer
- **Combat Systems**: Emotion-influenced warfare mechanics
- **Diplomacy**: Inter-tribe relations and negotiations
- **Internal Strife**: Social tensions and power struggles

### üß¨ Evolution Layer
- **Genetic Inheritance**: Physical and cognitive trait passing
- **Cultural Memory**: Traditions, myths, and historical events
- **Generational Change**: Long-term societal transformation
